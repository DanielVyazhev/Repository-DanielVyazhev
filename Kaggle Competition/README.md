# Kaggle Competition  

#### Project task:
In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. That primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

#### What tasks were accomplished:
My goal in this contest was to increase the RMSE value, we used Lasso and Ridge models for the predictions, which we subsequently improved.
