# Repository-DanielVyazhev
This repository is intended for projects as a portfolio for admission to a master's programme "Business Analytics and Big Data Systems"
This repository contains what I think are 4 of my most interesting projects for my master's program that I completed as part of my Yandex studies.

[Diploma of completion of the Data Analyst](https://yadi.sk/i/ImyHOL_QHBmu7g)

Additional education in data analysis is preparing me for a career as a data analyst, helping me learn how to clean and organize data, identify patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate important results. 

I have used the following Python libraries in these projects: `Pandas` ; `Matplotlib` ; `Seaborn` ; `Scikit-learn` ; `NumPy` ; `SciPy`; 'SQLAlchemy` .

# Sprint - Business metrics analysis
[**Analysis of ProcrastinatePRO+**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/blob/main/Анализ%20убытков%20приложения%20ProcrastinatePRO%2B/Анализ%20убытков%20приложения%20ProcrastinatePRO%2B.ipynb)
