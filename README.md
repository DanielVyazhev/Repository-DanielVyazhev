# Repository-DanielVyazhev
This repository is intended for projects as a portfolio for admission to a master's programme "Business Analytics and Big Data Systems"
This repository contains what I think are 4 of my most interesting projects for my master's program that I completed as part of my Yandex studies.

[Diploma of completion of the Data Analyst](https://yadi.sk/i/ImyHOL_QHBmu7g)

Additional education in data analysis is preparing me for a career as a data analyst, helping me learn how to clean and organize data, identify patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate important results. 

I have used the following Python libraries in these projects: `Pandas` ; `Matplotlib` ; `Seaborn` ; `Scikit-learn` ; `NumPy` ; `SciPy`; `SQLAlchemy` .

# Sprint - Business metrics analysis
[**Analysis of Application**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/blob/main/Анализ%20убытков%20приложения%20ProcrastinatePRO%2B/Анализ%20убытков%20приложения%20ProcrastinatePRO%2B.ipynb)

#### Project Task:

A task for a marketing analyst for the entertainment app Procrastinate Pro+. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been making losses for the last several months. Our task is to figure out the reasons and help the company come out in the black.

#### Project Description: 

Analysis of data from ProcrastinatePRO+ was performed.
Calculated various metrics and used cohort analysis: LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU etc. **Used previously written functions to calculate the metrics**. Conclusions on the obtained data are made.

# Sprint - Statistical analysis of data
[**Statistical analysis of data**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/blob/main/Определение%20выгодного%20тарифа%20для%20телеком%20компании/Определение%20выгодного%20тарифа%20для%20телеком%20компании.ipynb)

#### Project Task:

Analyze customer behavior and search for the optimal tariff based on cellular operator's customer data.

#### Project Description: 

A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers was carried out, analyzed customer behavior when using the operator's services and recommended optimal sets of services for users. The preprocessing of the data, their analysis. The hypotheses of the difference in the revenues of the subscribers of different tariffs and the the difference in revenues between subscribers from Moscow and other regions.

# Sprint - Decision-making in business
[**Testing hypotheses to increase revenue in the online store -Evaluate A/B test results**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/tree/main/Проверка%20гипотез%20по%20увеличению%20выручки%20в%20интернет-магазине%20—%20оценить%20результаты%20AB%20теста)

#### Project Task:

Using data from the online store to prioritize hypotheses, evaluate the results of A/B-testing using different methods.

#### Project Description: 

Prioritized hypotheses on ICE and RICE frameworks. Then we analyzed the results of the A/B-test, plotted cumulative revenue, average check, conversion by group, and then calculated the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks on the raw and purified data. Based on the analysis, we decided that it was inexpedient to continue conducting the test.

# SQL project: Database Analysis.
[**SQL Project**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/blob/main/SQL%20Project/SQL%20Project.ipynb)

#### Project Task:

Analyze the database to formulate a value proposition for a new product Examine information about books, publishers, authors, and user reviews of books.

#### Project Description:

Our first task is to analyze the database. It contains information about books, publishers, authors, and user reviews of books. This data will help formulate a value proposition for the new product.

# Kaggle Competition  

[**Kaggle Comptetion**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/tree/main/Kaggle%20Competition)

#### Project task:
In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. That primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

#### What tasks were accomplished:
My goal in this contest was to increase the RMSE value, we used Lasso and Ridge models for the predictions, which we subsequently improved.

# Enterprise Architecture of X5 Retail Group

[**Enterprise Architecture**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/tree/main/Enterprise%20Architecture%20of%20X5%20Retail)

This student project was done with the goal of digitalization and increasing profits through improved enterprise architecture.
The project was done in an archimate language environment.
The project presents SWOT Analysis, Business Model Canvas, Enterprise Business Architecture at all levels. That all you can see in presentation of the project.

#### Project Task: 
Increase company profits and digitalization through enterprise architecture techniques.

#### My role in the team
I have been involved in the development of technical architecture for the enterprise, the development of cloud system models and participated in the development of motivational models, kanvas and SWOT models. One way or another I was able to contribute to each of the developments in our team, but my main task remained to build the technical architecture 

# Decision Making in Business

[**Decision Making**](https://github.com/DanielVyazhev/Repository-DanielVyazhev/tree/main/Decision%20Making%20in%20Business)

To open a local business, an entrepreneur needs to understand the level of potential demand for his services or goods at a particular point. Actually, millions could be invested, a great level service could be achieved, but the business would go broke in a couple of months, because there is simply no target audience in the location.
Previously, this problem was solved in primitive ways. The entrepreneur chose several locations that seemed promising to him. Then he or specially hired people simply watched the passers-by, manually analyzed the buildings and establishments that already exist there. You can't collect a lot of data like that, but you can draw some conclusions.

#### Project Task: 
The difficulty is that the investment risks in such an analysis are very high. After all, the patency of the point may be excellent, but there will be a minimum of the target audience in it. Starting a business turns into a lottery: lucky or not.
could be resolved:
• accurate assessment of the volume and solvency of the target audience interested in specific goods or services;
• analysis of the supply-demand graph in the location;
• saturation of the competitive environment check;
• tracking the availability and cost of available space for starting a business.

#### My role in the team
This project involved writing code, pre-processing data and visualising the data, and calculating the results.
